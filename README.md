# CS350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was basically a thermostat. I had to set up the temperature sensor to take a reading and compare it to the setpoint using a task scheduler. The GPIO was used to configure the buttons to change the setpoint. The UART functionality was used to report out the data every period. GPIO functionality was also used to toggle the LED on or off based on the heat being on or off. 

What did you do particularly well?
I feel I got better at most things during the course. Modularization was my best work on this project. 

Where could you improve?
I need more practice with the state machine for sure. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The number one thing I need to get better with embedded systems is practice and examples. I am a kinestheitc learner so hands on with examples is the best way for me to get better.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The state machine functionality using the switch/case scenario was a new, but useful, tool in programming. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Modularization is the best way I know how to reuse, maintain, and adapt code. One tip I picked up from a friend is to save methods you write/remove in a note file with a description for later use.
